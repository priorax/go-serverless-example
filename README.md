# go-serverless-example

## Requirements
  - go
  - node
  
## Getting started
 - `npm install`
   - Install the AWS CDK cli
 - `npm run build`
   - I'm lazy, sue me

   - .... Take a guess

## Troubleshooting
 - If you get an error saying "This stack uses assets", run the following from inside the "infra" folder

## Notes
  - This directory structure is awful, I was just playing with things and wanted to move fast and break things.
